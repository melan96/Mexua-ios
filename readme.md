SwiftUI 🍎 based progressive Application for reduce anxious behaviours.
Mexua helps you relax by guiding you through a simple breathing 🍃 exercise, commonly used to reduce 🙆‍♂️ anxiety. That was the main reason I created it, so I could cope better with anxiety plus learning how to code. I hope you like it.
